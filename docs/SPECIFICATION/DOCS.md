# Documentation specification
In this file we define the rules and schemes to follow when writing the documentation.

First, important rule, everything must be written in English (not from a specific country as long it's understandable). Second, we always refer to us as a group, until it's strictly relevant to mention an individual. We are a community, and we must reflect this in our communication. We should try to refer to our users personally, through the usage of "you", but this is contextual, since sometimes is better to refer to them as "users".

Always use ISO8601 for dates and times. The preferred separators are e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` or `YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss`.
