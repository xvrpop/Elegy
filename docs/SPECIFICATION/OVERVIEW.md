# Overview
This document aim is to explain what is Elegy purpose.

Elegy<sup>1</sup> is a fully-featured music player. 
Our goal is to offer a practical, powerful, but also stunning interface.
Paired with a slick management of the music library and an audio experience of quality.

The aim of Elegy is ambitious. We want to design the **all-in-one** solution for managing a personal music experience.

We also want to give users full control over their experience. With not only extensive settings, but also a powerful extensions system.

And lastly, but probably one of the most important things: 

## Research
Our music player has to satisfy as many people we can. That's why our extension system is the most important part of the player.

Our target user goes from the amateur who likes to just listen to their unorganized library, to the expert who customizes the experience with tagging, playlists, EQs, etc.
People that have thousands of songs, and who love a fancy and customizable GUI.
Basically those outsiders who don't use streaming services, or use multiple and need a middle ground.

To summarize:
- Age â‰ˆ> 16
- Amateurs
- Audiophiles
- Who customizes their listening experience
- Who loves fancy GUIs
- People who don't use streaming services (at least not mainly).

## Notes
1. An [elegy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegy) could be vaguely defined as a lament. We chose this name not only because, in our opinion, it sounds good. But because we are unhappy with the current (as of 2025/03) state of open source music players.
