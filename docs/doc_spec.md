# Documentation specification
In this file we define the rules and schemes to follow when writing the documentation.

First, important rule, everything must be written in english (not from a specific country as long it's understandable); and in plural.

Always use ISO8601 for dates and times. The preferred separators are e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` or `YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss`.

### About meta.json5
For now. I suggest to manually maintain a json5 to describe useful metadata about the files within a folder. We may automate portions of this process in the future, and merge it all in one, big, file.
