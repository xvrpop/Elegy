# Elegy Identity

Elegy is a software for the community. It uses a strong copyleft license (AGPLv3) to make this clear. We care about User data is processed locally (on user device).
Our philosophy is to craft the best user experience for us and you. And to make the user independent from us, and make Elegy accessible for everyone. Complex features may require knowledge on the technologies involved, but we aim to provide decentralized technologies with automatic setup for ease of use.

As stated in the introduction, we aim to provide all these features while maintaining the user independent from us. No centralized servers or closed source features, and make them easy to use for the user.
