# Changelog
We merge all changelogs into this single file. The structure of the changelogs is shared, but we maintain 4 different changelogs.

- **Desktop**: relative to desktop releases. Versions of desktop and mobile could, and probably will, mismatch.
- **Mobile**: about mobile releases.
- **Docs**: any change to the documentation.
- **Dev**: internal changes about development.

**There's an important annotation to be made:** as you can see our changelog and plan we refer to a **meta version**, which is related to the whole project. Under each release you'll find specified the version of the modified components. Those who aren't specified are unchanged, so look into older releases.

We use [SemVer](https://semver.org) for versions, and [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org) as a guideline for our changelogs.
